- Please generate html with Tailwind css accordingly, don't worry about JS functionalities for now.
- Please make it responsive.
- We will use recharts library later for creating charts, so please consider it when making html & css layout. And you can provide codes with planned project folder structure.

I know I'm providing sufficient datasets for you to create UI, but you may create those fake necessary dataset example based on your knowledge and experience. I believe you can.
However, if you need more information to make it complete, please feel free to ask me.
Thanks.
